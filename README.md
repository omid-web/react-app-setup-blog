[Link to setting up pipeline project](https://www.coguard.io/post/ci-cd-pipeline)

This article demonstrates how to start building a react application, get it committed to GitHub and set up linting and code scanning. Then we set up and use GitHub Actions, Docker, Docker Compose, GitHub Secrets and CoGuard to build and secure the initial CI/CD pipeline. This initial investment and steps has laid the groundwork for a faster deployment pipeline. It has added key tools and items to help the team build faster and reduce the risk of accidentally introducing bugs.
